## Project Overview

Inspired by the need for streamlining and automation in the travel industry. The system aims to provide tourists with an integrated platform to plan and manage their trips efficiently and easily.

Our system has an intuitive and easy-to-use interface and functions, and also provides a wealth of travel information. The system helps travelers to plan their journey conveniently, including the functions of hotel booking, taxi booking, flight booking and activity booking. All expenses are added up at the end and a general bill is printed to help travelers manage their expenses .
